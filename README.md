## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I had to learn a few aspects about these new programming languages since I haven't used them recently. I played around with them and made sure my syntax was correct by looking the warnings given by the IDE. Implementing the game design took a bit of time, but I just had to plan it out on pen and paper and then translate that implementation into code.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[None! Web development is very similar in concept to Swift in iOS development, I feel like they share a lot of features and core concepts. I am excited to learn more about web development now!]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would probably implement more features to the game, such as allowing the user to add more buttons and configuring the game to their liking.]
